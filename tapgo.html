                    <h2>Design for everyone</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to make Tap & Go an app that is easy and enjoyable for everyone to use. During my research phase, I interviewed three people with three very different lifestyles. Using what I found, I was able to determine frustrations each user had and what they were looking for in an app.</p>

                        <p>Christina works long hours and and doesn't have a lot of time to plan things out. I wanted to make sure that Tap & Go has plenty of events to choose from that happen throughout the day. Since she can easily reserve her spot right from the event page, she will be able to do more things spur of the moment.</p>

                        <p>Hannah's number one priority is her daughter. However, Hannah is tired of going to the same mommy-and-me groups all the time. When it comes to filtering results on Tap & Go, I wanted to make sure that it's easy to find events that are kid friendly. That way she is not swiping through options that are innapropriate for her needs.</p>

                        <p>Of users interviewed, Kevin is the one with the most flexibily in his schedule. He is able to actually make plans. That's why I wanted it to be easy to toggle between weeks on the Tap & Go dashboard to find events in the category he chooses. This will eliminate a lot of the frustrations he has with it taking too long to find things to do.</p>

            <p>Below is a prototype of Tap & Go that I made using InVision. It is not fully functional, but it helps me in determining what areas of the interface need help. <br> Give it a try! With your mouse, just click where you normally would. If you get stuck, just click anywhere on the prototype and the blue marks will guide you.</p>
