                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>The Oak & Vine site has a lot of components, so it is very important to keep continuity throughout the pages. Creating a style guide like the one below assists me in making sure each page is uniform.</p>

                    <h2>Concept & Research</h2>
                        <p>What is it that makes Oak & Vine different than any other online wine store? Well, part of it would be the "Wine Finder Quiz" - A quiz that matches you with a variety of awesome wines that are guaranteed to make you smile. Oak & Vine gives all customers a clear starting place. Using the wine finder quiz, you only have to answer a few short questions to get wine recommendations based on your results. </p>
                    
                    
                        <div class="oak-style">
                        <img src="assets/oakquizresults.png">
                        </div>
                        
                        
                        <p>But why a quiz? Well, while doing research, I found a site that has a great wine quiz but the result ends up taking you to a wine subscription service. Other wine quizzes have results that are purely informational or the results are way too detailed. In one of the surveys I conducted, a majority of participants said that they would use the tool:</p>
                        
                        <div><img src="assets/quiztool.png"></div>
                        
                        <p>I personally like the idea of having a subscription service, but in another survey, I found out that most people would rather purchase bottles individually:</p>
                        
                        <div><img src="assets/quizsubscription.png"></div>
                 
                        <p>However, what if you already know what kind of wine you like? Well, nearly 70% of people who took my survey say that they can hold their own when it comes to wine.</p>
                            
                        <div><img src="assets/quizexpert.png"></div>
                        
                        <p>But then again, like many of us, 80% of respondents are still searching for "the one". </p>
                            
                        <div><img src="assets/quizlikes.png"></div>
                        
                        <p>So conclusively, even if you know that you prefer pinot noir over merlot, shopping online for wine can still be difficult. There are enless bottles of wine out there and the goal of Oak & Vine is simply to help you find something that you'll enjoy without having to spend extensive time searching. 
                        That's why beyond the fantastic wine finder quiz, Oak & Vine also features highly customizable search and filter options, customer reviews, articles and of course big, bold icons so flavor profiles can be easily identified at a glance.</p>
